Overview:
The sequence sub-system is designed to manage and consume event timelines.  A 
sequence is in itself a description of either how/when other events are to be 
generated/raised or describing when an event is to be expected.  The basics of 
a sequence is a series of nodes ordered on a timeline, each node defines the 
duration of time between itself and the previous node.  Given a data stream 
input nodes perform operations required for each update to detect if the 
expected event has occured.
